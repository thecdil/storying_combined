Carlton Loop,brad-smith-encounter-beehive-lakes,carltonloop,"Dedicated to the memory of environmental activist Jasper Carlton, this trail begins with a caribou encounter at Beehive Lakes before proceeding to the ESA-designated critical habitat near Little Snowy Top mountain—the site of the last Idaho ranging mountain caribou. The trail then descends to a mid-elevation cedar-hemlock forest in the Ball Creek drainage which served as important early winter caribou habitat. After this section you’ll meet an individual who contributed to the listing of mountain caribou as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act."
