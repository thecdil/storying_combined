The website is developed and maintained by Devin Becker using a customized version of the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) framework that features an interactive [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) map as background and mechanism for viewing collection items as well as custom interpretive features that utilized [Tufte CSS stylesheet](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) to style interpretive and informational content. These and other customizations can be viewed in the project's [Github repository](https://github.com/thecdil/storying_combined).
